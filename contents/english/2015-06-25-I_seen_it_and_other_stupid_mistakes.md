### stereotypes 刻板印象 

a widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing. 

A stereotype is when we say, anything like this, the rest is exactly the same.

### accordingly 從而 

appropriately, correspondingly, suitably

in a way that is appropriate to the particular circumstances.

> We have to discover what his plans are and act accordingly.

consequently, therefore, for that reason

> There was no breach of the rules. Accordingly, there will be no disciplinary inquiry.

## Simple past 過去簡單式

> I saw it.

> I saw the movie.

> I saw you yesterday.

When we say simple past, we say, **something was true.** 

Something happened. **It happened before and it is true**.


## Past Participle 過去分詞

Past particliple(PP) means **something in the past**.

**When you participate, it means you're a part of something.**

It usually particaipates by having a perfect form: **have had**, **has had**, **had had**

PP有兩個字, 所以要用兩個字: 

> I have seen this before.

> I had seen you.

> He has seen you.

## "if" stands for "imagine"

**I**f --> **I**magine 

If I see an "if", then should use "**were**" instead of "**was**".

> If I were you, I **would** go back and do the lesson again.

"wa**s**" for "**s**ituation": 

> Is this a real situation?
