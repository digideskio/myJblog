## conform 

> A zero arguments function that returns an object, conforming to the iterator protocol.


## whenever 

> Whenever an object needs to be iterated (such as at the beginning of a for..of loop), its @@iterator method is called with no arguments, and the returned iterator is used to obtain the values to be iterated.


## realize --> realizing

實現

> Don’t require realizing an array, enabling lazy design patterns like LINQ.

## delegate

> When the iterator's next() method is called, the generator function's body is executed until the first yield expression, which specifies the value to be returned from the iterator or, with yield*, delegates to another generator function.
